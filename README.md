# MY STUFF:
This is where I put stuff that I have coded over the years. I've been coding
since I was 8 years old. It brings me joy to make stuff like this. I hope
that you like it, and have fun with it all.

# SCARE WARNING:
The VBscript "'Ello! Welcome to my computer!" is designed to scare a snoop and then 
shut down your computer. It is 100% harmless, despite the shutdown.

# SEIZURE WARNING:
The program "rainbow" flashes rainbow colors in rapid succession.
Do not launch it if you are prone to seizures.

# INFO:

The Matrix programs will either make rainbow code (matrix2) or green code (MATRIX).

The Text-To-Speech program will make your computer say what you type.

Quiz programs will let you play trivia games.

The Passgen 2000 will generate completely random strings of numbers that you can
set as passwords. The program does not store these and never will.

The CustomCalc program is a calculator.
