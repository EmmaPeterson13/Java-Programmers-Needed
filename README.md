# MY STUFF:
This is where I put stuff that I have
coded over the years. I've been coding
since I was 8 years old. It brings me
joy to make stuff like this.

# WARNING:
The file "'Ello! Welcome to my computer!"
is designed to scare a snoop and then 
shut down your computer. It is 100%
harmless, despite the shutdown.
